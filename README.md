Welcome to the Fun Cipher Project! This is a simple Python-based tool where you can encode and decode messages using a quirky custom cipher. It‚Äôs a fun little project to learn about cryptography and string manipulation!

## Features

- **Custom Cipher**: A totally unique way to scramble and unscramble your messages.
- **Encrypt & Decrypt**: Make your secrets safe and sound, or reveal them again.
- **String Magic**: Uses Python's string power to twist your words into mystery and back.

## How to Use

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer.
2. **Clone the Repo**: Grab the project by cloning it from GitHub.
3. **Run the Script**: Open the folder and run the script, then follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt your messages.

## Customization

Feel free to mess around with the cipher! You can tweak it, break it, or make it even more secret if you like.
